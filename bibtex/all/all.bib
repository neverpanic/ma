	systematic product-line development. Largely
	independent work on reuse ('domain analysis') and
	object-oriented technology ('design and code') has

		support the description of the product line as a whole, as well
		as its instantiation for the derivation of individual products.
		Literature has already addressed how to create and instantiate
		generic product line assets, such as domain models and
		architectures to generate instance specific ones [1, 2, 3],
		yet little attention has been given on how to actually deal
		with this genericity at the code level. This paper addresses

		the Maintainability of the {Linux} Kernel.},
	abstract    = {Data coupling between modules, especially common coupling, has long
		been considered a source of concern in software design, but the issue
		is somewhat more complicated for products that are comprised of kernel
		modules together with optional nonkernel modules. This paper presents
		a refined categorization of common coupling based on definitions and
		uses between kernel and nonkernel modules and applies the
		categorization to a case study. Common coupling is usually avoided when
		possible because of the potential for introducing risky dependencies
		among software modules. The relative risk of these dependencies is
		strongly related to the specific definition-use relationships. In a
		previous paper, we presented results from a longitudinal analysis
		of multiple versions of the open-source operating system Linux. This
		paper applies the new common coupling categorization to version 2.4.20
		of Linux, counting the number of instances of common coupling between
		each of the 26 kernel modules and all the other nonkernel modules. We
		also categorize each coupling in terms of the definition-use
		relationships. Results show that the Linux kernel contains a large
		number of common couplings of all types, raising a concern about the
		long-term maintainability of Linux.},

		AOP. In an object oriented C++ framework, aspects have
		been identified which now have been separated from the
		components of the framework. In this paper, the focus
		is on life-cycle control aspects when applying the
		Command Processor pattern. Because no weaver technology
		was available, preprocessor macros were used. They
		simulate both operation and statement-level join
		points. Making the aspects of the code explicit yielded
		positive results. Introduction Recently, I came across
		AOP and wanted to evaluate the idea. Even more, after
		having read a couple of papers I wanted to profit from
		AOP immediately, although I am a novice in AOP. From
		experience it was well known, that the API of a
		framework never reflected the internal complexity.
		Growing complexity meant to make relationships among
		components more complex and/or put more and more code
		into methods that actually already did their job. The
		latter option often seemed to allow hig...",

		operating systems) are not predictable enough and are
		not scalable because they use the wrong paradigm. I.e.,
		they use the conventional OS paradigm, only try to make
		it faster (fast being a relative term). Fairness and
		average response time should not be a considerstion in
		a RTOS, but rather that critical tasks are guaranteed
		to complete within their deadline, and that as many
		other tasks as possible do so as well. In the Spring
		kernel, tasks are categorized as {\em critical}, {\em
		essential} and {\em non-essential}. Critical tasks are
		given an a priori guarantee and resources are reserved
		for them, whereas essential tasks are guaranteed
		on-line. The Spring kernel is implemented as a network
		of multiprocessors, called the SpringNet.",

  abstract =     {We present a study of how Linux kernel developers respond to bug reports issued by a static analysis tool. We found that developers prefer to triage reports in younger, smaller, and more actively-maintained files (§2), first address easy-to-fix bugs and defer difficult (but possibly critical) bugs (§3), and triage bugs in batches rather than individually (§4). Also, although automated tools cannot find many types of bugs, they can be effective at directing developers ’ attentions towards parts of the codebase that contain up to 3X more user-reported bugs (§5). Our insights into developer attitudes towards static analysis tools allow us to make suggestions for improving their usability and effectiveness. We feel that it could be effective to run static analysis tools continuously while programming and before committing code, to rank reports so that those most likely to be triaged are shown to developers first, to show the easiest reports to new developers, to perform deeper analysis on more actively-maintained code, and to use reports as indirect indicators of code quality and importance},

Therefore the tool CPP is an important standard asset in the development toolchain for classical system software written in C.  Yet, nobody has seriously quantified the effects of implementing variability with conditional compilation.  In this report we describe conditional compilation in a semi-formal way.  On this basis, we present an algorithm that is able to calculate the resulting variability.  With this, we believe that further analysis on variability caused by preprocessor based configuration can be supported.  This is useful to detect bugs caused by inconsistencies between variability models in the actual implementation and to support exploration of actually implemented variability in source artifacts.},

To allow for the automatic derivation of a concrete product based on a given variant configuration, a mapping between features in the problem space and their realisations in the solution space is required. It is crucial to support the developer in the complex task of defining such mappings. These mappings can also be used to provide visualisations of the variant space that allow to reason over variability in SPLs. In this paper we present FeatureMapper, a tool that allows for defining mappings of features to model elements specifying feature realisations. These feature realisations can be defined in arbitrary Ecore-based languages. Furthermore, the tool supports different visualisation techniques that can help developers understand the complex designs of SPLs.},

Although conditional compilation is powerful, it can be difficult to understand and is error prone. In large software systems, file inclusion, conditional compilation and macro substitution are closely related and are often largely interleaved. Without adequate tools, understanding complex header files is a tedious task. This practice may even be complicated as the hierarchies of header files grow with projects. This paper presents our experiences of studying conditional compilation based on symbolic execution of preprocessing directives. Our two concrete goals are: for any given preprocessor directive or C/C++ source code line, finding the simplest sufficient condition to reach/compile it, and finding the full condition to reach/compile that code line. Two different strategies were used to achieve these two goals. A series of experiments conducted on the Linux kernel are presented.},

  abstract =     {It is difficult to develop style-preserving source-to-source transformation engines for C and C++. The main reason is not the complexity of those languages, but the use of the C pre-processor (cpp), especially ifdefs and macros. This has for example hindered the development of refactoring tools for C and C++.  In this paper we propose to combine multiple techniques and heuristics to parse C/C++ source files as-is, while still having only a few modifications to the original grammars of C and C++. We rely on the fact that in most C and C++ software, programmers follow a limited number of conventions on the use of cpp which makes it possible to disambiguate different situations by just looking at the context, names, or indentation of cpp constructs.  We have implemented a parser, Yacfe, based on these techniques and evaluated it on 16 large open source projects. Yacfe can on average parse 96\% of those projects correctly. As a side effect, we also found mistakes in code that was not compiled because it was protected by particular ifdefs, but that was still analyzed by Yacfe. Using Yacfe on new projects may require adapting some of our techniques. We found that as conventions and idioms are shared by many projects, the adaptation time is on average less than 2 hours for a new project.}

  abstract =     {The C preprocessor is heavily used in C programs because it provides useful and even necessary additions to the C language. Since preprocessor directives are not part of C, they are removed before parsing and program analysis take place, during the phase called preprocessing. In the context of refactoring, it is inappropriate to remove preprocessor directives: if changes are applied on the preprocessed version of a program, it may not be possible to recover the un-preprocessed version. This means that after refactoring, all the source code would be contained in a single unit, targeted to a single configuration and without preprocessor macros.  This thesis describes a novel approach to preserve preprocessor directives during parsing and program analysis, and integrate them in the program representations. Furthermore, it illustrates how the program representations are used during refactoring and how transformations preserve preprocessor directives.  Additionally, the semantics of the C preprocessor are formally specified, and the results of implementing this approach in a refactoring tool for C, CRefactory, are presented.}

  abstract =     {The C preprocessor is heavily used in C programs because it provides useful and even necessary additions to the C language. Since preprocessor directives are not part of C, they are removed before parsing and program analysis take place, during the phase called preprocessing. In the context of refactoring, it is inappropriate to remove preprocessor directives: if changes are applied on the preprocessed version of a program, it may not be possible to recover the un-preprocessed version. This means that after refactoring, all the source code would be contained in a single unit, targeted to a single configuration and without preprocessor macros.  This thesis describes a novel approach to preserve preprocessor directives during parsing and program analysis, and integrate them in the program representations. Furthermore, it illustrates how the program representations are used during refactoring and how transformations preserve preprocessor directives.  Additionally, the semantics of the C preprocessor are formally specified, and the results of implementing this approach in a refactoring tool for C, CRefactory, are presented.}

% extends SSA to handle arrays and objects, in Java-like langs. Builds upon the
% original Array SSA - by splitting classes up into heap-arrays of appropriate
% fields, and indexing into these heap arrays by object references (quite
% clever!) Then just uses standard Array SSA transformation. three kinds of phi
% nodes - standard, then array defn phi, then array use phi. Rename arrays each
% time we do a lookup (cf SSU). Uses global value numbering instead of points-to
% analysis to determine when object references are same/different. Analysis
% enables scalar replacement - remove redundant loads, then redundant stores.
% Comments that transformation to SSA leads to flow-sensitivity property.
% Actually implemented in IBM Jalapeno JIT compiler.

	abstract = {Modern operating systems are strongly dependent on software
		mechanisms to protect system resources from users. This is true despite the
		fact that the promoters of these systems imply that their reliability and
		integrity derive solely from the use of a core set of protected hardware
		mechanisms, such as address spaces and protected supervisor mode. While
		typical microprocessors provide cheap and effective hardware mechanisms to
		protect the load word/store word interface, operating systems are forced to
		abstract and virtualize this interface to export a far richer set, of
		resources such as files, sockets, threads, and consoles. The access semantics
		for these resources are almost always protected by software checks and not
		hardware. Processor architectures simply do not provide enough fine-grained
		control over access to shared system resources to ensure that a program only
		accesses the resources to which it is allowed. Our position is that software
		protection mechanisms are not only necessary, but have inherent advantages
		over hardware for enforcing the protection requirements of an operating
		system. Software is flexible, explicit, precise, and in many cases, open to
		incredible optimizations. By contrast, hardware mechanisms are rigid,
		 implicit, imprecise, and unoptimizable.},

		With the wide-spread adoption of Java, there is significant interest in using
		the language for programming real-time systems.
		The community has generally viewed a truly real-time garbage collector as being
		impossible to build, and has instead focused its efforts on adding manual
		memory management mechanisms to Java.  Unfortunately, these mechanisms are an
		awkward fit for the language: they introduce significant run-time overhead,
	introduce run-time memory access exceptions, and greatly complicate the
		development of library code.
		In recent work we have shown that it is possible to build a real-time collector
		for Java with highly regular CPU utilization and greatly reduced memory
		footprint.  The system currently achieves 6 ms pause times with 50\% CPU
		utilization (MMU) and virtually no ``tail'' in the distribution.
		We show how this work can be incorporated into a general real-time framework,
		 and extended to systems with higher task frequencies.  We argue that the community
		 should focus more effort on such a simple, orthogonal solution that is true to
		 the spirit of the Java language.",

		Now that the use of garbage collection in languages like Java is becoming
		widely accepted due to the safety and software engineering benefits it
		provides, there is significant interest in applying garbage collection to
		hard real-time systems.
		Past approaches have generally suffered from one of two major flaws: either
		they were not provably real-time, or they imposed large space overheads to
		meet the real-time bounds.
		Our previous work~\cite{bacon:03:acmsignote} presented a mostly non-copying
		real-time collector with worst-case pause times of 12 milliseconds while
		maintaining consistent mutator CPU utilization rates of 45\% with only 1.6--2.5
		times the maximum heap space required by the application, which is comparable
		with space requirements for stop-the-world collectors.
		However, that algorithm assumed a constant collection rate and ignored
		program-dependent characteristics.  This paper refines that model by taking
		into account program properties such as pointer density, average object size,
	and locality of object size.  This allows us to bound both the time for
		collection and consequently the space overhead required much more tightly.  We
		show experimentally that most parameters usually are not subject to large
		variation, indicating that a small number of parameters will be sufficient to
		predict the time and space requirements accurately.
		Our previous work also did not present the details of our approach to avoiding
		and undoing fragmentation.  In this paper we present a more detailed analysis
		of fragmentation than in previous work, and show how our collector is able to
		bound fragmentation to acceptable limits.",

	abstract={ Real-time systems have traditionally been developed using
		low-level languages such as Assembly or C. It would be desirable to have the
		option of using a high-level language such as Java to aid in the development
		of these systems. Java is an object-oriented, robust, secure programming
		platform that provides an enormous library of classes to make implementing
		common programming tasks trivial. However, most high-level languages such as
		Java lack the run-time performance critical to real-time systems. To address
		the performance issues and equip Java for real-time systems, Sun has published
		a specification to standardize an application interface and the implementation
		of a real-time Java Virtual Machine. The real-time specification for Java was
		published in November of 2001 but has not been accepted by industry as Sun
		might have hoped. The restrictive nature of the application interface may be
		to blame for this nonacceptance as opposed to lack of interest or need. This
		restrictive nature is apparent after examining the memory management model
		enforced by the specification which this paper explores. Low-level system
		programmers are accustomed to managing memory manually through global memory
		or by way of the malloc/free standard library functions. Java programmers are
		accustomed to relying on an automatic garbage collector to manage the task of
		reclaiming unused memory. Since an automatic garbage collector is impractical
		for most real-time systems, an alternative mechanism for reclaiming unused
		memory is required. Instead of providing the application programmer with an
		additional operator to reclaim memory, such as delete, the specification
		mandates the implementation of a collection of memory classes. This paper
		addresses the error prone and complex task of manual memory management within
		the constraints of the Sun specification and suggests modifications that might
		allow Java to be used as an embedded language.},

Unfortunately, little tool support exists to help maintainers gain insight into the build system, much less to refactor it. In this paper, we therefore present the design and implementation of a re(verse)-engineering framework for build systems named MAKAO. At its heart the framework makes the build's dependency graph available in a tangible way. Aside from visualisation, this enables powerful querying of all build-related data, as well as various filtering techniques to define views on the build architecture. If desired, all this gathered information can be put to use to write aspects for refactoring the build. Afterwards, validation rules can help in assessing failure or success. We applied our implementation on an industrial C system and the Linux 2.6.16.18 kernel, with good results.}

In this paper we take a look at this phenomenon in the Linux kernel from its inception up until present day. We do this by analysing the kernel's build traces with MAKAO, our re(verse)-engineering framework for build systems. This helps us in detecting interesting idioms and patterns in the dynamic build behaviour.

		This paper presents a new storage representation for cons cells (and all other
		LISP heap data structures) which allows more time efficient LISP with
		real-time garbage collection on stock hardware. Stock hardware refers to
		common modern architectures for Von Neumann uni-processors (e.g. MC68000,
		IBM370, VAX, NS32032, etc.). Previous real-time garbage collection schemes
		have either explicitly required specially tailored hardware in order to avoid
		multiple order of magnitude slowdowns, or have been merely extremely
		unattractive for implementation on stock hardware due to the high overhead
		assumed by all basic LISP primitives in checking the garbage collection status
		of pointers handed to them as arguments. We first show that copying compacting
		real-time garbage collection algorithms do not always need to protect user
		programs from seeing uncopied data, so long as a slightly more complicated
		collection termination condition is used. This opens the way to adding an
		indirection pointer to all LISP heap objects making it unnecessary to check
		the garbage collection status of pointers, and so the overhead costs for most
		primitives reduce to the addition of a single instruction. Impure primitives,
	i.e. those which write into existing structures (e.g. RPLACD), have their
		overhead reduced by a factor of almost 2. Code density is correspondingly
		decreased. The cost of this scheme is increased storage size for all LISP heap
		objects one extra pointer per object, although for some objects (e.g. floating
		point numbers) this expense is already necessary in many other non real-time
		garbage collection algorithms.

	abstract    = {Software applications often consist of implicit knowledge for making decisions or giving advice in addition to object-oriented functionality. A rule-based system can be employed for representing and reasoning with this knowledge. Although several hybrid systems exist that combine object-oriented programming and rule-based reasoning, a survey we conducted reveals that both paradigms are not well integrated and programs are tightly coupled.We propose hybrid aspects for integrating object-oriented programming and rule-based reasoning. As expected, hybrid aspects specify join points where normal execution is interrupted and advice is executed. However, since two different languages are involved, we need join point models for both and advice that activates both. As such, we complement a simple join point model for object-oriented programming with a join point model for rule-based reasoning. Hybrid advice is independent of the interrupted language and supports sending messages as well as activating rules. It uses values of either language transparently.We present OReA, an implementation of hybrid aspects for weaving Smalltalk and a rule-based system. We discuss and illustrate two applications of hybrid aspects.},

Based on concepts of AspectJ it extends the Smalltalk MOP to accommodate the aspect modularity mechanism. In contrast to systems like AspectJ, weaving and unweaving in AspectS happens dynamically at runtime, on-demand, employing metaobject composition. Instead of introducing new language constructs, AspectS utilizes the expressiveness of Smalltalk itself as a pointcut language.}

	comment = {We can adopt two different perspectives during analysis: focusing on changes over time
		or focusing on variations within a family. We can think of variations in a family as occurring in
		“space,” as different conﬁgurations that coexist in time for different customers or markets. These
		two approaches have separate but related goals.  By focusing on commonalities in a family of
		abstractions for a product or product line, we increase architectural abstraction. We reduce
		development effort—this is reuse at its best. We might notice that there are several different
		window system technologies and create a parameterized design sensitive to the kinds of variation.
		Doing that allows us to deploy a family of systems in which Thesis Presentation: The Need for
		Multiple Paradigms 48 each member of the family incorporates a different window technology. This is
		the strategy most commonly associated with the term domain analysis.  By focusing on what will
		remain common over time, we try to lower mainte- nance cost. We try to predict how the domain will
		change. Better yet, we try to predict how it won’t change, cast that as a commonality, and capture
		it in the system’s structure. Variabilities should express what changes over time. A good design
		anticipates market changes over the lifetime of the system and predicts how badly they upset
		commonality assumptions. Predicting wrong can be expen- sive and can lead to those all-too-familiar
		situations in which a small requirement change leads to a large development effort. History is
		often a good predictor of the future: What has remained stable in the past often remains stable in
		the future. },

		a simple but effective means to implement

		or without these fragments can be created, which can
		be used (among others) to implement software product
		lines. Although, preprocessors are frequently used in

		effect on code quality and maintainability. In
		contrast to modularized implementations, for example
		using components or aspects, preprocessors neglect
		separation of concerns, are prone to introduce subtle
		errors, can entirely obfuscate the source code, and
		limit reuse. Our aim is to rehabilitate the
		preprocessor by showing how simple tool support can
		address these problems and emulate some benefits of
		modularized implementations.  At the same time we
		emphasize unique benefits of preprocessors, like
		simplicity and language independence. Although we do
		not have a definitive answer on how to implement
		variability, we want highlight opportunities to
		improve preprocessors and encourage research toward
		novel preprocessor-based approaches.},

		modeling commonality and variability in product
		families. In their basic form, feature models contain
		mandatory/optional features, feature groups, and
		implies and excludes relationships. It is known that
		such feature models can be translated into
		propositional formulas, which enables the analysis and
		configuration using existing logic- based tools. In
		this paper, we consider the opposite translation
		problem, that is, the extraction of feature models
		from propositional formulas. We give an automatic and
		efficient procedure for computing a feature model from
		a formula. As a side effect we characterize a class of
		logical formulas equivalent to feature models and
		identify logical structures corresponding to their
		syntactic elements. While many different feature
		models can be extracted from a single formula, the
		computed model strives to expose graphically the
		maximum of the original logical structure while
		minimizing redundancies in the representation. The
		presented work furthers our understanding of the
		semantics of feature modeling and its relation to
		logics, opening avenues for new applications in
		reverse engineering and refactoring of feature
		models.},

  abstract =     {Configurable software is ubiquitous, and the term Software Product Line (SPL) has been coined for it lately. It remains a challenge, however, how such software can be verified over all variants. Enumerating all variants and analyzing them individually is inefficient, as knowledge cannot be shared between analysis runs. Instead of enumeration we present a new technique called lifting that converts all variants into a meta-program, and thus facilitates the configuration-aware application of verification techniques like static analysis, model checking and deduction-based approaches. As a side-effect, lifting provides a technique for checking software feature models, which describe software variants, for consistency.  We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by checking configuration dependent hazards for the highly configurable Linux kernel which possesses several thousand of configurable features. Using our techniques, two novel bugs in the kernel configuration system were found.},

  abstract =     { In many projects, lexical preprocessors are used to manage different variants of the project (using conditional compilation) and to define compile-time code transformations (using macros). Unfortunately, while being a simply way to implement variability, conditional compilation and lexical macros hinder automatic analysis, even though such analysis would be urgently needed to combat variability-induced complexity.  To analyze code with its variability, we need to parse it without preprocessing it. However, current parsing solutions use heuristics, support only a subset of the language, or suffer from exponential explosion. As part of the TypeChef project, we contribute a novel variability-aware parser that can parse unpreprocessed code without heuristics in practicable time. Beyond the obvious task of detecting syntax errors, our parser paves the road for further analysis, such as variability-aware type checking. We implement variabilityaware parsers for Java and GNU C and demonstrate practicability by parsing the product line MobileMedia and the entire X86 architecture of the Linux kernel with 6065 variable features.  },

Unfortunately, the task of creating a feature model for an existing project is both daunting and time-consuming, requiring substantial effort from a modeler.  We present procedures for reverse engineering feature models, based on a crucial heuristic for identifying parents---the major challenge of this task. We also automatically recover constructs such as feature groups, mandatory features, and implies/exclude edges. We evaluate the technique on two large-scale software product lines with existing reference feature models---the Linux and eCos kernels---and FreeBSD, a project without a feature model. Our heuristic is effective across all three projects. It ranks the correct parent among the top results for vast majority of features.  We effectively reduce the information a modeler has to consider from thousands of choices to typically five or less.},

  abstract =     {Maintaining variation in software is a difficult problem that poses serious challenges for the understanding and editing of software artifacts. Although the C preprocessor (CPP) is often the default tool used to introduce variability to software, because of its simplicity and flexibility, it is infamous for its obtrusive syntax and has been blamed for reducing the comprehensibility and maintainability of software. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a prototype for managing software variation at the source code level. We evaluate the difference between our prototype and CPP with a user study, which indicates that the prototype helps users reason about variational code faster and more accurately than CPP. Our results also support the research of others, providing evidence for the effectiveness of related tools, such as CIDE and FeatureCommander.},

		on a computer program. It is a supposition for debugging,
		enhancement, re-use, and documentation. There are a few
		approaches that support automatic program understanding.
		Current approaches can be classified in basic and
		knowledge-based analyses. Basic analyses do not rely on the
		application domain and any programming knowledge. They are
		only based on programming language syntax and semantic.
		Basic analyses can be distinguished into basic static and
		basic dynamic analyses, depending on whether the
		information is gained at compile time or runtime.
		Knowledge-based analyses dispose of application domain
		knowledge and programming knowledge. They can be further
		classified in parsing approaches, if they only fall back
		upon formal and structural program properties, and informal
		reasoning, if they use additionally informal knowledge.
		This paper explains the taxonomy with examples.},

  abstract =     {Parsing of programs with preprocessing directives and conditional compilation is challenging. Symbolic evaluation offers a fundamental and general approach to solve the main difficulties. It can find, for every line of code, the Boolean expression under which it is compiled or reached and all the possible values of preprocessing variables (macros) for each line of code. Conditional values have been shown an effective representation to do fast practical symbolic evaluation of preprocessing; but their interaction with macro expansion and evaluation has not been formally investigated. We present convergent rewrite systems over conditional values that can interact with macro expansion and evaluation and transform them into Boolean expressions. Once transformed, well known simplification techniques for Boolean expressions can be applied. This entails a more complete solution to the efficient symbolic evaluation of C-preprocessing using conditional values.}

	abstract =   {Analyses of C source code usually ignore the C
		preprocessor because of its complexity. Instead, these
		analyses either define their own approximate parser or
		scanner, or else they require that their input already
		be preprocessed. Neither approach is entirely
		satisfactory: the first gives up accuracy (or incurs
		large implementation costs), while the second loses
		the preprocessor-based abstractions. We describe a
		framework that permits analyses to be expressed in
		terms of both preprocessing and parsing actions,
		allowing the implementer to focus on the analysis. We
		discuss an implementation of such a framework that
		embeds a C preprocessor, a parser, and a Perl
		interpreter for the action hooks. Many common software
		engineering analyses can be written surprisingly
		easily using our implementation, replacing numerous
		ad-hoc tools. The framework's integration of the
		preprocessor and the parser further enables some
		analyses that otherwise would be especially difficult
		to perform.},

  abstract =     {The Linux kernel is extensively specialized or configured so that it can be used for many purposes. This variability is implemented by means of three distinct artifacts: source code files, Kconfig (configuration) files, and Make files. Any inconsistencies between these three can lead to undesirable anomalies which can lead to increased maintenance efforts or decreased reliability. This paper extends published work that had found anomalies (dead and undead code blocks) by concentrating largely on code and Kconfig files. We detect further anomalies in the Linux kernel when we also consider the Make files. At the level of code blocks, our work exposes many additional anomalies - more than we could study manually. We found that when we lift the level from code blocks to code files, the detected anomalies became easier to study and understand and thus more useful to the developer. By means of examples, we illustrate how the anomalies we detect can lead to undesired behavior. We show how, over time, developers tend to find and delete such anomalies. We suggest that automatic detection of such anomalies has the potential to decrease maintenance efforts and increase reliability.}

		first. They are then commented upon, and supplemented by additional
		definitions, which address the threats to dependability and security
		(faults, errors, failures), their attributes, and the means for their
		achievement (fault prevention, fault tolerance, fault removal, fault
		forecasting). The aim is to explicate a set of general concepts, of
		relevance across a wide range of situations and, therefore, helping
		communication and cooperation among a number of scientific and
		technical communities, including ones that are concentrating on
		particular types of system, of system failures, or of causes of system
		failures.},

  abstract =     {Over 30 years ago, the preprocessor cpp was developed to extend the programming language C by lightweight metaprogramming capabilities. Despite its error-proneness and low abstraction level, the preprocessor is still widely used in present-day software projects to implement variable software. However, not much is known about how cpp is employed to implement variability. To address this issue, we have analyzed forty open-source software projects written in C. Specifically, we answer the following questions: How does program size influence variability? How complex are extensions made via cpp's variability mechanisms? At which level of granularity are extensions applied? Which types of extension occur? These questions revive earlier discussions on program comprehension and refactoring in the context of the preprocessor. To provide answers, we introduce several metrics measuring the variability, complexity, granularity, and types of extension applied by preprocessor directives. Based on the collected data, we suggest alternative implementation techniques. Our data set is a rich source for rethinking language design and tool support.},

  abstract =     {Concurrency bugs are widespread in multithreaded programs. Fixing them is time-consuming and error-prone. We present CFix, a system that automates the repair of concurrency bugs. CFix works with a wide variety of concurrency-bug detectors. For each failure-inducing interleaving reported by a bug detector, CFix first determines a combination of mutual-exclusion and order relationships that, once enforced, can prevent the buggy interleaving. CFix then uses static analysis and testing to determine where to insert what synchronization operations to force the desired mutual-exclusion and order relationships, with a best effort to avoid deadlocks and excessive performance losses. CFix also simplifies its own patches by merging fixes for related bugs.  Evaluation using four different types of bug detectors and thirteen real-world concurrency-bug cases shows that CFix can successfully patch these cases without causing deadlocks or excessive performance degradation. Patches automatically generated by CFix are of similar quality to those manually written by developers.},

We used KLEE to thoroughly check all 89 stand-alone programs in the GNU COREUTILS utility suite, which form the core user-level environment installed on millions of Unix systems, and arguably are the single most heavily tested set of open-source programs in existence. KLEE-generated tests achieve high line coverage — on average over 90\% per tool (median: over 94\%) — and significantly beat the coverage of the developers ’ own hand-written test suite. When we did the same for 75 equivalent tools in the BUSYBOX embedded system suite, results were even better, including 100\% coverage on 31 of them. We also used KLEE as a bug finding tool, applying it to 452 applications (over 430K total lines of code), where it found 56 serious bugs, including three in COREUTILS that had been missed for over 15 years. Finally, we used KLEE to crosscheck purportedly identical BUSYBOX and COREUTILS utilities, finding functional correctness errors and a myriad of inconsistencies.  },

The emphasis is on usability: the tool supports almost all ANSI-C language features, including pointer constructs, dynamic memory allocation, recursion, and the float and double data types. From the perspective of the user, the verification is highly automated: the only input required is the BMC bound. The tool is integrated into a graphical user interface. This is essential for presenting long counterexample traces: the tool allows stepping through the trace in the same way a debugger allows stepping through a program.},

A feature implements a stakeholder’s requirement and represents a design decision or configuration option. When added to a program, a feature involves the introduction of new structures, such as classes and methods, and the refinement of existing ones, such as extending methods. A feature-oriented decomposition enables a generator to create an executable program by composing feature code solely on the basis of the feature selection of a user—no other information needed. A key challenge of product line engineering is to guarantee that only well-typed programs are generated. As the number of valid feature combinations grows combinatorially with the number of features, it is not feasible to type check all programs individually. The only feasible approach is to have a type system check the entire code base of the feature-oriented product line. We have developed such a type system on the basis of a formal model of a feature-oriented Java-like language. The type system guaranties type safety for feature-oriented product lines. That is, it ensures that every valid program of a well-typed product line is well-typed. Our formal model including type system is sound and complete.},

		Software-product-line engineering is an efficient means to generate a family of program variants for a domain from a single code base. However, because of the potentially high number of possible program variants, it is difficult to test them all and ensure properties like type safety for the entire product line. We present a product-line--aware type system that can type check an entire software product line without generating each variant in isolation. Specifically, we extend the Featherweight Java calculus with feature annotations for product-line development and prove formally that all program variants generated from a well-typed product line are well-typed.  Furthermore, we present a solution to the problem of typing mutually exclusive features. We discuss how results from our formalization helped implementing our own product-line tool CIDE for full Java and report of experience with detecting type errors in four existing software-product-line implementations.},

		The C preprocessor is commonly used to implement
		variability. Given a feature selection, code fragments
		can be excluded from compilation with \#ifdef and similar
		directives. However, the token-based nature of the C preprocessor
		makes variability implementation difficult and errorprone.
		Additionally, variability mechanisms are intertwined
		with macro definitions, macro expansion, and file inclusion.
		To determine whether a code fragment is compiled, the entire
		file must be preprocessed. We present a partial preprocessor
		that preprocesses file inclusion and macro expansion, but
		retains variability information for further analysis.We describe
		the mechanisms of the partial preprocessor, provide a full
		implementation, and present some initial experimental results.
		The partial preprocessor is part of a larger endeavor in
		the TypeChef project to check variability implementations
		(syntactic correctness, type correctness) in C projects such as
		the Linux kernel.

	ABSTRACT = {
		Software product lines have gained momentum as an approach to
		generate many variants of a program, each tailored to a specific
		use case, from a common code base. However, the implementation
		of product lines raises new challenges, as potentially millions of
		program variants are developed in parallel. In prior work, we and
		others have developed product-line--aware type systems to detect
		type errors in a product line, without generating all variants. With
		\emph{TypeChef}, we build a similar type checker for product lines written
		in C that implements variability with \emph{\#ifdef} directives of the
		C preprocessor. However, a product-line--aware type system for C
		is more difficult than expected due to several peculiarities of the
		preprocessor, including lexical macros and unrestricted use of \emph{\#ifdef}
		directives. In this paper, we describe the problems faced and our
		progress to solve them with \emph{TypeChef}. Although \emph{TypeChef} is still
		under development and cannot yet process arbitrary C code, we
		demonstrate its capabilities so far with a case study: By type checking
		the open-source web server \emph{Boa} with potentially $2^{110}$ variants,
		we found type errors in several variants.

  abstract =     {How to reconfigure a general purpose operating system (GPOS) into an embedded operating system has attracted attention for application-specific domains. Linux is currently one of the popular candidates for GPOSs. Although Linux has tools for kernel reconfiguration by letting users add or remove desired function modules, the best schemes of reconfiguring Linux according to a specific embedded system are not practical. Even after this configuration, the target Linux might still be a GPOS. In this article, we will propose an approach to customizing an application-specific Linux operation system. This approach derives from a ¡§call graph¡¨ based on reengineering. By analyzing a graph-structure representation of the target system, its hardware and software specifications are determined. Thus, we can find the rules for removing the redundant code in Linux. Moreover, we employ the call graph approach to verify the system integrity at the source-code level. In order to demonstrate the proposed idea, an experimental system will also be reported in this article. The results show that our approach can significantly remove about 17 percent of the Linux kernel¡¦s footprint with respect to unreachable code.},

Determining the state-space coverage of a proposed or executed test suite traditionally involves qualitative assessment, rendering meaningful comparative analysis between tests for a given system or across multiple systems difficult. We propose a method for assessing state-space coverage of a test suite utilizing t-wise testing, a combinatorial technique borrowed from the software testing community which generalizes pair-wise testing. We refine traditional notions of a t-wise test suite to analyze the configuration coverage of a test plan. This provides a methodology and a set of metrics to assess both the level and the distribution of state-space coverage. We detail a proof-of-concept experiment using this partial t-wise coverage framework to analyze Integration and Test (I\&T) data from three separate NASA spacecraft.}

Although individually useful, as a group these techniques present difficulties to system developers because they are not based on a common framework which might simplify integration and promote portability and reuse. The paper presents techniques for developing Generic Software Wrappers-protected, non-bypassable kernel-resident software extensions for augmenting security without modification of COTS source. We describe the key elements of our work: our high-level Wrapper Definition Language (WDL), and our framework for configuring, activating, and managing wrappers. We also discuss code reuse, automatic management of extensions, a framework for system-building through composition, platform-independence, and our experiences with our Solaris and FreeBSD prototypes},

  abstract =     {The kernel which forms the core of the Linux system is the result of one of the largest cooperative software projects ever attempted. Regular 2-3 month releases deliver stable updates to Linux users, each with significant new features, added device support, and improved performance. The rate of change in the kernel is high and increasing, with between 8,000 and 12,000 patches going into each recent kernel release. These releases each contain the work of over 1,000 developers representing nearly 200 corporations. This is the fourth update of this document, which has been published roughly annually since 2008. It covers development through the 3.2 release, with an emphasis on the releases (2.6.36 to 3.2) made since the last update. It has been a busy period, with seven kernel releases created, many significant changes made, and continual growth of the kernel developer and user community.},
