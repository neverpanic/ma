info: extended the scope of 12 allocations.
76 of 174 (43.68%) allocation sites in this repository use task-local heaps
13 allocations have overlapping liveness regions and are thus not considered for task-local heap allocation
Remove the tasklocal_heaps_avoid_overlap flag to allocate those from task-local heaps anyway.
Escape count distribution:
         local: 89 (51.15%)
        method: 32 (18.39%)
        global: 53 (30.46%)
