info: extended the scope of 12 allocations.
75 of 174 (43.10%) allocation sites in this repository use task-local heaps
13 allocations have overlapping liveness regions and are thus not considered for task-local heap allocation
Remove the tasklocal_heaps_avoid_overlap flag to allocate those from task-local heaps anyway.
Escape count distribution:
         local: 88 (50.57%)
        method: 33 (18.97%)
        global: 53 (30.46%)
