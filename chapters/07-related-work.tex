	Read a gazillion of papers that seem remotely related to what I've been doing. Tell everybody my stuff is much better,
	because it's automatic. Do not forget to compare to region-based allocation and automatic region inference, because
	that's very similar to what I've done (the difference being region-based approaches usually do not use stack
	allocation).
