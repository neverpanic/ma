\chapter{Evaluation}
	\label{chapter:eval}
	In order to determine whether the optimizations implemented in this thesis actually improve compiled programs, its
	results should be compared to systems generated without the optimizations. A series of criteria can be evaluated to
	find differences between different runs. Some of them can be determined without running the generated program, such as
	code size and the number of optimized allocations. Others require measurements at runtime, such as heap memory usage
	or execution speed.

	Any measured application should be as close as possible to real-world usage to yield representative results. On the
	other hand, any benchmark should produce output that can be easily processed, compared and graphed. Rather than using
	a series of micro-benchmarks targeting a certain aspect of the system, previous work on KESO used an open source
	real-time Java benchmark family for embedded systems~\cite{erhardt:11:diplom, erhardt:11:jtres, stilkerich:11:cpe}.
	This benchmark is called Collision Detector (CD\textsubscript{x}), its Java variant CD\textsubscript{j}, and was
	published by Kalibera et al.\ in 2009~\cite{kalibera:09:jtres}. It consists of two main components:
	\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
		\item an \emph{air traffic simulator} that generates a stream of radar frames and passes them to
		\item the \emph{collision detector}, which scans the radar frames for potential aircraft collisions.
	\end{inparaenum}

	The KESO project uses two variants of this benchmark depending on the size restrictions of the target platform. The
	\emph{on-the-go} variant generates the radar frames in the collision detector task and avoids the overhead of passing
	the frames between the two components. At the cost of less realism, this modification significantly shrinks the size
	of the generated binary and reduces the memory requirements. Due to the lower system requirements, this version of the
	benchmark fits and runs on an Infineon TriCore TC1796 board used for testing.

	The second, larger version of the CD\textsubscript{j} benchmark used to test the KESO compiler and its optimization
	result is called the \emph{simulated} variant. This type runs the air traffic simulator in a separate protection
	domain and passes the generated frames to the collision detector using a queue. When frames are generated faster than
	they can be processed (i.e., when deadlines are not met), frames are dropped. Due to heap size requirements and code
	size, this variant of the benchmark does not fit on the TriCore board. Since runtime measurements in a simulated OSEK
	or AUTOSAR OS environment are heavily affected by jitter, time-sensitive measurements are only conducted using the
	\emph{on-the-go} variant.

	The test setups consisting of relevant compiler and software versions and system specifications are given
	in~\cref{tbl:eval:setup}. Measurements of the \emph{on-the-go} benchmark always use the TriCore system, others are
	built and run on Linux using an OSEK emulation layer. These emulation layers are either JOSEK~\cite{josek:10} or
	Trampoline~\cite{bechennec:06:etfa}. All runtime measurements use KESO's \emph{CoffeeBreak} stop-the-world garbage
	collector for heap memory management.

	\section{Static Results}
		\label{sec:eval:static}
		The number and percentage share of optimized allocations can be used as a compile time criterion for the quality of
		KESO's optimizations. The higher the number and share of automatically managed objects, the lower the heap load,
		which possibly reduces garbage collector usage. \Cref{fig:eval:static:numallocs} lists the number of stack
		allocations, task-local heap allocations and the total number of allocations in the CD\textsubscript{j}
		\emph{on-the-go} benchmark. For the number of stack allocations without using scope extension, the share of
		optimizations fell from 34.4~\% before this thesis to 30.1~\%. This drop is caused by the removal of 43 allocations
		likely due to improved removal of unused fields, which has been added to KESO between these measurements. Using
		task-local heaps instead of stack allocation increases the percentage of optimized allocation sites to 39.0~\%. The
		13 additional optimizations are local objects with overlapping liveness regions that are left unmodified in stack
		allocation to avoid unbounded growth of stack usage. Enabling scope extension in the same measurement adds another
		28 allocations created by copying allocation bytecode instructions into multiple callers. This will likely also
		increase code size (see also~\cref{sec:eea:probs}). The 28 additional allocations are created instead of 12
		allocation sites that are eligible for scope extension. Each of the dozen allocations is thus propagated into
		3.33\footnote{$\dfrac{174 - (146 - 12)}{12}$} callers on average. The number of stack allocations increases by 32
		from 44 (30.1~\%) to 76 (43.7~\%). Note that these are statically determined numbers, i.e., the actual number of
		objects allocated at runtime does not change despite the increase in allocation instructions. The number of
		allocations not converted into stack allocations due to overlapping liveness regions of the allocated objects stays
		the same. Consequently, the number of allocations using task-local heaps stays at the same margin to stack-allocated
		ones in comparison to the measurement without scope extension.

				after this thesis with and without scope extension.}
			\label{fig:eval:static:numallocs}
		\end{figure}

		Results for the \emph{simulated} variant (given in~\cref{fig:eval:static:numallocs:simulated}) show similar behavior
		albeit with lower percentages of optimized statements. These are caused by the much lower share of \emph{local}
		objects relative to the total amount of allocations. Between the results from before this thesis and those without
		scope extension, the number of total allocations was reduced again, likely due to removal of unused fields. The
		percentage of allocations that use stack memory stayed roughly equal (18.1~\% vs.~18.0~\%). Scope extension
		increases the total number of allocation sites by 74 to 109.3~\%. This should also result in a significant increase
		of the code size. Another 28 allocations are eligible for stack allocation after scope extension. Again, the number
		of objects with overlapping liveness regions hardly changes between the measurement with and without scope extension
		– in the \emph{simulated} variant, it increases by 29 (one allocation more than stack allocation) from 20.3~\% to
		21.9~\% of all allocations.

			\label{fig:eval:static:numallocs:simulated}
		\end{figure}

		As expected, stack allocation and task-local heap allocation increase the size of the code. In the \emph{on-the-go}
		variant shown in~\cref{subfig:eval:static:size:onthego} increases once escape analysis is enabled. This increase is
		caused by inlining the code that initializes an object's header data. Previously, this initialization was only
		present in a single place (the allocation function) in the binary. Because stack allocations have been added in
		multiple places, this initialization code gets replicated and increases the binary size. Additional runtime code
		further increases the code size. New runtime functions and the explicit creation and destruction of regions at entry
		and exit points of methods increase the text segment size when task-local heaps are used. As predicted
		in~\cref{sec:eea:probs} scope extension further increases the size of the code unless methods with candidates for
		the optimization only have a single caller. Since the \emph{on-the-go} variant extends variable scope into 3.33
		callers on average, growth of the text segment is expected. Overall, the text segment's size increases only
		moderately to a maximum of 104.0~\% compared to the smallest selection.

		For the \emph{simulated} CD\textsubscript{j} benchmark in~\cref{subfig:eval:static:size:simulated}, code size
		behaves similar when enabling escape analysis, both with the stack and task-local heap allocation backends. Again,
		task-local heaps need a little more space, but the growth is small in comparison with the code size ($\le$ 1.2~\%
		relative to the variant with stack allocation). For the simulated benchmark, enabling scope extension significantly
		increases code size by up to 20.3~KiB or 9.3~\%. Most of the additional allocations are created by a small number of
		methods (e.g., a generated parser) that, however, allocate a large number of escaping objects. Limiting the number
		of optimizations per method as suggested in~\cref{sec:eea:probs} or other heuristic limits could stem this problem.

			\label{fig:eval:static:size}
		\end{figure}

		The data segment size does not change for stack allocation. When using task-local heaps, each configured task-local
		heap adds two additional pointers to the data segment. For the \emph{on-the-go} variant, the size of the data
		section grows by 24 bytes (the size of two pointers on the 32-bit TriCore target architecture times three task-local
		heaps). The larger \emph{simulated} variant uses four tasks – its data segment size increases by 32 bytes.

	\section{Runtime Results}
		\label{sec:eval:runtime}
		While static analysis shows a significant share of allocations is optimized, it is not immediately obvious that the
		use of automatic memory management reduces the benchmark's runtime. While a reduction in execution time is not
		imperative because reducing heap memory usage (and with it garbage collector load) is a worthwhile end itself,
		a large runtime overhead of other automatic memory management method might still make garbage collection the method
		of choice in all but corner cases. Measurements at runtime will also help determine whether the optimized
		instructions are located in much frequented code paths or outside the standard control flow (e.g., in error handling
		code). Hence, runtime data should reveal whether the optimizations improve application behavior and are useful.

		All measurements in this section were conducted on the TriCore system setup as described in~\cref{tbl:eval:setup}.
		The data always shows the average of five runs. The standard deviation of the measurement values was always lower
		than 0.06~\% for time measurements and equal to 0 for heap memory usage. For this reason, none of the plots use
		error bars – they would simply not be visible.

				\end{inparaenum} relative to a run without escape analysis-based optimizations (plain).}
			\label{fig:eval:rt:relmem:ea}
		\end{figure}

		\Cref{fig:eval:rt:relmem:ea} graphs the relative heap memory usage of the collision detector CD\textsubscript{j}
		after escape analysis. The median heap usage for escape analysis with the stack allocation optimization backend is
		only 50.7~\% relative to a run without optimizations based on escape analysis. When using task-local heaps instead
		of stack allocation, the median heap usage drops to 50.1~\% due to the added optimizations of allocations that
		create objects with overlapping liveness regions. Other than expected, the impact of those allocations is small,
		even though they can be executed multiple times because they are in loops. Compared to the state of escape analysis
		before the improvements implemented in this thesis (see~\cref{sec:ea:improve}) heap memory usage has been massively
		improved from the previous median usage of 99.6~\% of the baseline\footnote{Measurements representing the state
		before this thesis were made using KESO r3092. The version of CiAO used was the same across all measurements. Since
		the baseline was generated using KESO r4072, the EA+stack BT values are not the percentage of improvements that
		would be measured if the baseline was generated using r3092. Do not use the line to rate the previous
		implementation. It can, however, serve as a reference to visualize the improvements in this thesis.}.

			\end{inparaenum} relative to a run without escape analysis-based optimizations (plain). For comparison, heap
			memory usage for escape analysis and stack allocation (EA+stack) as in~\cref{fig:eval:rt:relmem:ea} is also
			shown.}
			\label{fig:eval:rt:relmem:se}
		\end{figure}

		When enabling scope extension, the fluctuations in heap memory usage present in the optimized variants given
		in~\cref{fig:eval:rt:relmem:ea} are smoothed: In~\cref{fig:eval:rt:relmem:se}, the points measured for scope
		extension have considerably less variation than those of a run with escape analysis only. The median heap usage is
		reduced to 50.4~\% and its standard deviation is reduced from 1.51 percentage points for escape analysis with stack
		allocation to 0.94 percentage points. When using task-local heaps, the numbers are again similar to stack allocation
		but a little lower: The median heap memory usage is 49.8~\%, the standard deviation decreases from 1.41 to 0.76
		percentage points. The lower variance is probably caused by invocations that only occur in some of the collision
		detector iterations. The invoked methods allocate objects in heap memory. These allocations seem to be candidates
		for scope extension and are hence no longer allocated in the heap when the optimization is enabled.

		For runtime measurements, the CD\textsubscript{j} benchmark internally reads values from a high resolution timer
		before and after a collision detector run. The difference (i.e., the duration) is stored in a global array and
		printed after the simulation completes. Again, escape analysis shows significant
		improvements:~\Cref{fig:eval:rt:time:ea} contains the execution times of three configurations relative to the
		baseline without optimizations based on escape analysis. Before this thesis (measured using KESO r3092 and a current
		version of CiAO), the median runtime was 90.5~\% of the reference with a standard deviation of 0.79 percentage
		points\footnote{Note that the baseline was again generated with KESO r4072.}. Due to the changes implemented, the
		same configuration with escape analysis and stack allocation now performs significantly better with a median of
		81.1~\%. As the graph shows, some of the iterations have previously executed slower causing spikes in the graph. The
		impact of the spikes increases, which explains the higher standard deviation of 2.17 percentage points. As expected
		due to the additional instructions managing regions in task-local heaps on method entry and exit, stack allocation
		is faster than the code generated by the task-local heap allocation backend. The median runtime improvement for
		task-local heaps is 13.7~\% compared to 18.7~\% for stack allocation.

					\item escape analysis with task-local heaps (EA+TLH)
				\end{inparaenum} relative to a run without escape analysis-based optimizations. Times are measured in the
				application by reading from a high-resolution timer before and after each collision detector run. The difference
				is computed and shown.}
			\label{fig:eval:rt:time:ea}
		\end{figure}

		While enabling scope extension further reduces the heap memory usage, the same is not necessarily true for execution
		time, as~\cref{fig:eval:rt:time:se} shows. For the stack allocation backend, enabling scope extension slows down the
		median time needed by the collision detector by 1.14 percentage points to 82.3~\%. The task-local heap backend on
		the other hand, speeds up with scope extension by 0.59 percentage points to a median value of 85.5~\%. The increased
		time requirements with stack allocation might be another effect caused by over-optimization of pathologic examples
		as discussed in~\cref{sec:eea:probs}.

				\end{inparaenum} relative to a run without escape analysis-based optimizations (plain). Time measurements as
				in~\cref{fig:eval:rt:time:ea}.}
			\label{fig:eval:rt:time:se}
		\end{figure}

		Overall, enabling escape analysis considerably improves the performance and reduces the heap memory requirements. In
		situations where a danger of stack overflows exists, task-local heaps provide a safe alternative is exchange for
		a small overhead until KESO supports stack overflow checks or automatic worst-case stack usage and \gls{wcet}
		analysis. While the changes implemented for this thesis achieve a lower percentage of objects that are candidates
		for the optimizations, the runtime results are considerably improved: Execution time is reduced by up to 9.5
		percentage points, heap memory usage in collision detector runs is more than halved. It is thus recommended to
		enable escape analysis and one of its optimization backends for all applications.

		A similar suggestion can, however, not be given for scope extension. While it does reduce heap memory usage a little
		and reduces the variance between the collision detector iterations this optimization comes at the price of slower
		execution speeds in some configurations. Some of the examples tested expose at least some of the erratic behavior
		predicted in~\cref{sec:eea:probs}, for example by significantly increasing the code size. For some applications, the
		decreased variance that manifested in the \emph{on-the-go} variant of the benchmark when scope extension was
		activated might increase the predictability of the application. In real-time systems, this might make the
		optimization worthwhile. Whether scope extension improves an application's behavior should be determined on
		a case-by-case basis.
