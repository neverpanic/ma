\chapter{Evaluation}
	\label{chapter:eval}
	Give a brief overview of our test setup, which boards we use to test and which benchmarks we use.

	\section{Static Results}
		\label{sec:eval:static}
		Build a few test configurations and compare the number of stack allocations in the code. Possibly compare the code
		side and show the improvement compared to the results from my bachelor's thesis. Do this with more than one example,
		and probably also with Trampoline on x86.

	\section{Runtime Results}
		\label{sec:eval:runtime}
		This is awesome: we are saving up to 50\ \% of memory in CDj at runtime. That's cool! Also, the runtime is
		significantly reduced. Consider measuring GC runtimes and load.

	\section{Improvements by Scope Extension}
		\label{sec:eval:scopeext}
		Show that scope extension has improved the results by a factor of a gazillion. Or something. Wishful thinking,
		I know :(.
