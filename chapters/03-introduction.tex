\chapter{Introduction}
	\label{chapter:intro}
	Explain why embedded systems will rule the world in the future. Also explain current trends in embedded hardware and
	how everybody is trying to fit more stuff in less processors. If possible, find some numbers for that (I guess Daniel
	might have some data on that).

	\section{The KESO Multi-JVM}
		\label{sec:intro:keso}
		A few sentences on why Java is the new node.js of the embedded world. Explain isolation, safety and ease of use, put
		the KESO schematic overview there and explain some of it.

	\section{Previous Work}
		\label{sec:intro:prev}
		Recall what my bachelor thesis was about, find a few similar examples of people that use type-safe languages and
		ahead-of-time compilation to achieve isolation.

	\section{Motivation}
		\label{sec:intro:motivation}
		Explain the basic idea of scope extension and how it augments EEA\@. Also, outline some prospects of how scope
		extension will be all new, shiny and glory.

	\section{Document Structure}
		\label{sec:intro:document-structure}
